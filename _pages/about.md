# 🌈 Hi, there!

- I am a Master of Control Science and Engineering at Shandong University, working with Professor Yong Song. I received my Bachelor's degree in Automation from Zhejiang Sci-Tech University.

- My research interests focus on reinforcement learning and multi-robot systems. Currently, i am particularly interested in effective cooperation of heterogeneous multi-robot systems in complex scenarios, such as search-and-rescue tasks.

<!-- My research interest includes neural machine translation and computer vision. I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>). -->
